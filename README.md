# 36-Year Analysis of Commuting Patterns in Ireland (1986–2022)

## Project Overview
This project analyses Irish Census commuting data (1986–2022) to examine long-term changes in transport behaviour, with a focus on modal share, car dependency, gender differences and lifecycle travel patterns.
The analysis prioritises proportional metrics over absolute counts to identify structural behavioural shifts rather than population-driven growth.

## Key Findings
- Private motor transport for workers increased from **~64% in 1986 to nearly 80% by 2011.**
- Sustainable transport declined significantly and has not returned to 1986 levels.
- Gender differences exist but are modest compared to differences across activity types.
- Travel behaviour shows clear lifecycle patterns with car dependency strengthening into adulthood.

## Tools Used
